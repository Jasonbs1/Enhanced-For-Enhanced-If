Library Management System

Description:

The Library Management System is a Java-based application designed to help manage a library's resources and provide services to both librarians (Pustakawan) and library clients. It allows librarians to manage books, CDs, categories, authors, and publishers, as well as generate reports and manage fines. Clients can borrow and return books and CDs, check their fine status, and pay fines if necessary.
