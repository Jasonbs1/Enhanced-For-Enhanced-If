# Connecting a Java Program to a Database using Hibernate

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on connecting a Java program to a database using Hibernate.

## Prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of Java programming language
- Familiarity with relational databases and SQL
- Familiarity with Hibernate framework and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) concepts

## Objectives:

- Connect a Java program to a database using Hibernate
- Create a Hibernate configuration file to define database connection properties
- Define Hibernate mapping files to map Java classes to database tables
- Create Java classes to interact with the database using Hibernate

## Instructions:

### 1. Set up a database:

- Install a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.
- Create a database and a table to store data.

### 2. Set up Hibernate:

- Download and install Hibernate framework and add the required libraries to your Java project.
- Create a Hibernate configuration file (`hibernate.cfg.xml`) to specify database connection properties such as database URL, username, and password.

### 3. Define Hibernate mapping files:

- Create a Hibernate mapping file for each Java class that needs to be persisted to the database.
- In each mapping file, define the mapping between Java class properties and database table columns.

### 4. Create Java classes:

- Create Java classes to interact with the database using Hibernate.
- Use Hibernate APIs to perform database operations such as insert, update, delete, and select.

### 5. Test the program:

- Create a Java program to test the database connection and data manipulation using Hibernate.
- Execute the program and verify that the data is stored and retrieved from the database correctly.
